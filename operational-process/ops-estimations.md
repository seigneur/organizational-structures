# Effort Estimations

## Story Points

We are using story points based on task complexity and impact to assess the effort required for each task.
This is based on fibonacci series and more information can be read here.

1. Complexity : 
Low complexity - This task is trivial and can be done without much effort. eg. Change the color of a button;
High Complexity - This task requires a lot of deep thinking and effort from other team members;

2. Impact: 
Low Impact - It only involves one component;
High Impact - It involves cross modules and multiple components;


The following are what we currently use:

1. 0 - Low Complexity, Low Impact
2. 0.5 - Low - Medium Complexity, Low Impact
3. 1 - Low - Medium Complexity, Low - Medium Impact
4. 2 - Medium Complexity, Low Impact
5. 3 - Medium Complexity, Medium Impact 
6. 5 - High Complexity, Low Impact
7. 8 - High Complexity, High Impact - This is an epic and has to be split into smaller tasks
8. 13 - 21 - Epic that has to be split into smaller epics

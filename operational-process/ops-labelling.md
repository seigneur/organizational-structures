# Label Conventions on Trello

## Priority related labels

We have the following:

1. No Label : Usually bugs and some improvements are trivial;
2. Medium priority: If issue is some hotter or it is improvement;
3. High priority - you need to leave all your tasks for this task with high priority;
4. HOTFIX - It is something urgent crashing our app, imagine red alarms going off everywhere;
